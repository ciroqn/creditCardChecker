# Credit Card Checker

Checks for valid, invalid or yet-to-be-determined credit card numbers using Luhn algorithm. Credit card numbers can also be manipulated to pass the Luhn algorithm and change the credit card number. The source of the invalid credit card numbers can be traced using a unique identifier in the card number.
