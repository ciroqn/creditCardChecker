# Credit Card Checker

Checks for valid, invalid or yet-to-be-determined credit card numbers using Luhn algorithm. The sum of the credit card number can also be manipulated to pass the Luhn algorithm. The source (i.e. bank) of the invalid credit card numbers can be traced using a unique identifier in the card number.
